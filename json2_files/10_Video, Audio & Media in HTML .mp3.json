So do like this video and stay in this video because the examples I have used for video tags are very amazing. Let's go to the video screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10 and I will not waste your time by opening open with code by right-clicking. In fact, I will make it in index.html. And the topic of today's video is video. How to play a video, how to put a video in an HTML file, how to put audio, how to put media. So adding a video is very straightforward. I will copy it here, which is our video tag. It has an src attribute and it has some more attributes which I will discuss with you. But first of all, I want to tell you here that video src is equal to you will write here, so if you have video.mp4, it will play. So let's see here, I have put it here with control and I will click here and preview it. And you can see here that this video has come. Now it is a very big video, so what can I do? I can give its width. So I can say here width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact, I do not need to write px. I will only do 555, like in the image, we do not need to write px. Here too we will not need to write px. So as soon as I did width is equal to 555, in fact, I do one thing, I do height is equal to 555 so that it becomes smaller. In fact, I make it smaller, I do 255. And you see it came here. Now I play it because I have put control, I can play it. It is a better road than America. What name did you tell? Gopindra Jogi. Where have you been in the US? I have been to many places in the US. Name tell me. Gopindra Jogi. So the thing is that you can play the video like this. Now there are some attributes of the video tag here. It is very simple to use the video tag. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. After that you have given the controls. So these controls will come to you. You can download it, you can do full screen, you can do mute. You can do picture in picture. All this is automatically provided by your browser. But let me tell you about some attributes. The first attribute is src. So you know that put the video here. The name of the video file is src. This video file can also come from the external URL. Understand you people. That is, if I have uploaded a video on Amazon S3 or somewhere else, then I can also put the URL there. It is not necessary that the file is in your computer. It can be on your server. It can also come from the third party. Now what does the controls do? Adds video controls like play, pause and volume. Which we saw here in the video of Gopindra Jogi. That you are getting to see the controls here. Now what is this thing? The browser automatically sees what the control add will be in your video. What will not be. Then see what will autoplay do? It will automatically play as soon as the page is loaded. Okay. So if I put autoplay here. Suppose I put autoplay here. Okay. See what is happening here. So see. It's good. So you can see here that autoplay is done. Okay. So I will remove autoplay from here. And our next attribute is loop. That is, once our video is played, it will keep looping. Like I show you. See here, Gopindra Jogi. See here, you have started the market. So it started again. Once I finished it, it started again. So this loop works like this. The next attribute is muted. Muted mutes the video. So if I write here muted. Sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here on codewithhari.com. And I demonstrate something. Like downloading VS Code or something. So I use the muted attribute. Because I don't want that when I record a video. If there is any background noise, you can hear it. For example, I want to show you that this is the element. So I will scroll and make a video. I will highlight it like this. So I don't need audio in it. So I mute it. So you can use the muted attribute on your website. Then the poster. The poster is very important. So I have an image here. Download.jpg. If I write here, poster is equal to. And I write download.jpg. So you see, it will look like this. This is how the poster looks. Then I will play. So the video will play. So in a way, the thumbnail. You saw the thumbnail of the YouTube video. This is exactly the same. This is the poster attribute. So you can use all these attributes. You know that the width and height specify the dimension of the video. Like I added both width and height here. You saw. So I hope you understood this thing. Now the thing I want to tell you after this is audio. So this is for all the attributes of your video. It is very straightforward. I want you to make a website. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video. In quick quiz. So listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put the heading here. Quick quiz. So that I don't forget. I will give you this now. And this is going to be a very fun quiz. And everyone must solve it. But before that. As soon as you write audio, src comes here. And I have to put src in sachin.mp3. So as soon as I put sachin.mp3. Now see here. I will reload it. And there is no audio here. Which is strange. Let's see what the problem is here. I put src is equal to. I have to write controls here too. So if I don't write controls, I won't see the audio. See now the audio has come. I can see the controls here. I can also set the volume of this. I play this audio. Okay. So this is our audio. If I mute it and run it, it won't work. And I can also increase it. Okay. You have seen. So this is audio named sachin.mp3. Now what we will do. That. We will see some attributes of this audio. You know src. Source. Video file. Okay. Then after this, you know the controls. Play, pause and volume. Which we just saw. What will autoplay do? It will automatically play. If I have here. Autoplay. It will play automatically. Okay. So what does autoplay do? It automatically plays our audio. After this. The next attribute is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat. If I want to loop it. So I have autoplayed it. Now I will loop. Once. Second time. So you have seen. It was repeated. Means once it was saved. Then after that it was saved again. Because it was looped. So it is looped. So it is looped. So it is looped. So it is looped. So it is looped. So it is looped. So it is looped. So it is looped. So it is looped. Because I had looped the audio. Okay. So you have seen this thing. I looped sachin.mp3. So it was played once. Then it was saved. Then it was saved. Okay. What is sachin? Sachin. Okay. It was being said again and again. Because this mp3. It will be played again and again. So there are many cases. When you want. This mp3. To be repeated. Okay. So if you want. Your mp3 to be repeated. Then you can use it. Now. After this. Muted. What will it do? It will mute the audio. And definitely. You don't want. That by default. Your audio is muted. In most of the cases. But. Sometimes we will want. That. The audio is muted. And we can say here. To the user. Brother. Whoever wants to listen. Unmute it. Sachin. What is it? When do we do this? When there are multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios at once. You can mute them. The user can play. Unmute it. And see. Okay. So. You have control in your hand. If you want. You can use this thing. Okay. All in all. This is the thing. Now. Preload. The most confusing attribute. That's why. I have explained it. On codewithaddy.com. That the preload attribute. It can have these values. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates. That the browser should not. Preload the audio at all. Okay. Preload means. If you want. That the browser. Fetch the data. Then you will use. The preload attribute. Otherwise. You will not use the preload attribute. Okay. Preload is equal to none. It is the default value. Preload is equal to metadata. Means. That the browser. Only has metadata. Means. The information about that audio file. It will preload it. Means. It will load it from the beginning. And by doing auto. The browser will preload. The entire audio. Okay. So preload is equal to auto. If I do. Then it will download. And automatically. It will load. So that whenever the user plays it. Then the audio is saved. Okay. So. This is the work of the preload attribute. And in interviews. This preload attribute is asked a lot. So you should know. What is the preload attribute? Before moving forward. I want you to share this playlist. With your friends. Because I am seeing. That the audio file. Is being downloaded. And with your friends. Because I am seeing. That the interest is declining a lot. As we are moving forward in the videos. My request to you is. That you like this video. And along with that. As you are. Forking this repository. You should also star it. Okay. Your star. Your likes. All this will help me a lot. To bring such free courses. So this was. About audio and video tags. Okay. I have told you all the attributes. And you should definitely. Use it. I will give you all the images. So that you can try it out. Now a lot of people were asking. What is the preload attribute? So this is the preload attribute. And this is the preload attribute. And this is the preload attribute. Now a lot of people were asking. Can we use replit? See in this course. I have not used replit. But replit.com is an amazing website. If you want. You can use it in your phone. If you want to run html. There is a replit app. There is also for iOS. There is also for Android. So you can try it out. A lot of people are asking. How to do recording in the phone. Replit. But what I want now. VS code. Which most of the people. Want to use. Prefer. So I thought. Why not make videos in VS code. But I am. I am not a professional. I am not a professional. I am not a professional. I am not a professional. I thought why not make videos in VS code. But I personally. Use replit a lot. Infact videos also come in replit. Next topic is svg. Media related. What is svg. Svg is a format. With which you. Can create an image. With high graphics. Vector images. So if you copy. You can make a circle. In this. So svg is used. In the same way. As used. Our img tag. So see. If I put svg here. So this svg will come here. So this svg will come here. So this svg will come here. So this svg will come here. So this svg will come here. So this svg will come here. So this svg will come here. So this circular svg. So this circular svg. Came here. Video. Audio. Svg this. Are inline elements. That's why. We are able to see in one line. Right. You all saw it here. Now. What is here. You can also. Save svg file separately. You can save the svg file separately. Like if I write here. img.svg. And save the svg content. So if I am here. Then I will write img. And will write. img.svg. So you guys see here. That I don't need to see it. It comes here. So we will write. Here. that I didn't get to see this image. If I write alt here and write my svg image, then you will see here that my svg image has come like this, but I didn't get to see svg. Why did this happen? This happened because the svg, I write svg file in browser and whenever you want to see svg file in browser, then you will put a declaration above, I will show you. So I wrote svg file not showing here. So here is an answer of stack overflow which will tell you. So you will have to write this, I will show you. XML, something like this, see. You will have to add this. This is called namespace declaration. So you will have to add this svg. And now you see here, svg is visible. So this thing is very important and many people in future when you will make websites, then they will definitely get stuck in this problem. I keep getting stuck, okay. So I am telling you that the problem in which you will get stuck, I have already told you. You didn't get the problem, I told you the problem that is going to come and also told you the solution. Next topic is iframes. Iframes is also a very simple thing that you can embed another website from iframes in your website, okay. Like if I want to embed this webpage, then I can do it by using iframes in some way. So see, I wrote iframe this and I will copy this URL. And I will paste it here. And you see here that this website is completely embedded here in this much iframe, okay. So you definitely want to embed this in a big iframe. But if you want it to be embedded, then you can embed it in this way. I will do one thing, I will increase its height a little. So width is equal to width is written. Width is equal to, let's say 122. Height is equal to 444, okay. Assume. So see, it came out like this. Now definitely it was coming in this width, so it came in this line. But if I increase the width a little, let's say I increase the width to 322, okay. So see, my website is completely embedded here. You see, you can embed a website. Another use case of iframe is YouTube video. If you want to share YouTube video and click on embed here, then it will give you an iframe code. And you can start it here in any way. If you want to start at a particular time, then you can do that here. The point at which you will start and share it, that time comes here, which I will show you. Like I want to start from here, okay. Assume the video starts from here. So what I will do is click on share. After clicking on share, I will click on embed. I will start at 12.19 and I will copy it. See, there is a copy button here. And I will put it in my code here. So I will comment this iframe. And I will put it in the iframe below, okay. I will wrap the word so that you can see the code properly. So now what I will do is after pasting this, I will show you the document. See, this video is embedded here, okay. So I hope you understood this thing. And this is all there is in media HTML. Pretty much, okay. You will get to see a lot of things in miscellaneous topics. But pretty much that's all about media HTML. Audio, video, media is all there is. This is what you will use 95% of the times, okay. Now I will give you a quick quiz. And your quick quiz is this. Create a website which shows videos of different category, okay. And audios of different categories. You can use YouTube videos in an iframe. Using YouTube's embedding feature, okay. So what you have to do is, you have to create a website. In which you will get a lot of content. Now you can use video audio tags and YouTube's share feature. You can also embed it the same way I did with YouTube video. And make a very good website and show me. If you want, you can give me a GitHub comment. And if you want, you can also tell me the code and explain it. But do attempt this quiz. And do write Sigma Batch OP in the comment section. Access this playlist. Like this video. Do write Sigma Batch OP. That's all for this video guys. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time."
