I am really very happy that you all have given so much love to this course. Like this course with high energy. Because for a Sigma free course, you need to like the Sigma chats. In today's video, I will explain you the basic structure of a website. Along with that, I will tell you a mobile trick which will help you know how to preview your website on your phone. I have a request from you all that you all write in the comment section whether you know HTML or not. That will help me structure this course better. In this video, I will tell you the impact of chat GPT. Because there are a lot of talks going on about chat GPT these days. In the coming videos, I am going to give you a quiz. So understand this video very carefully and learn all the concepts. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come inside my computer screen. And now we will talk about how to create a lay of a website based on opening text, closing text, and structure. So here I will create a folder named video3. New folder, video3. And in video3, I will open it by right-clicking and choosing open with code. And here you can see that my theme is blue. And a lot of people said that blue theme is not good. Now see, the theme is your own choice. If you want to change the color theme, you can change your color theme. If you want to use GitHub dark, you can use GitHub dark. It's your choice. To create a new file, I will put index.html here. We had already talked about it that if I write the title of the page here, and write content here, and then using the link tag here, I can use Emmet here and link style.css. I am doing it so fast because we have already talked about it in the last video. And if I write script.js here, and if I write let us say alert hello here, then I will not tell you again and again that if I put a script tag here, just before the body, and then I put script.js here, and then I click here and open with browser, then this hello will come, and if I make the background of the body red here, it will become red. I will not tell you all this, because I have already told you this. Now I will tell you that what does this structure mean? Why did I write it so big? This is a doubt for a beginner that we can't write this title and content directly, what is the need to write so much? So I will tell you what is the need to write so much? I will reload it, see the content that was here, it came and it became red here. Now here you saw that I needed to reload the page. Many of you must have asked why did I need to reload? When it already reloads live. So I changed the CSS file. When I change the CSS file, at times we need to reload. If you are making changes in the HTML file, then you don't need to reload the changes in the HTML file. Now here what I will do, I will come back and explain to you. This is a basic structure of any HTML website. First of all, we write doc-type HTML, then we write HTML tag. Now see this is the opening tag of HTML tag, this is the closing tag. This is the opening tag of the body, this is the closing tag. This is the opening tag of the head, this is the closing tag. That is, whatever is inside it is the content of the head. Whatever is inside HTML, what is it? It is the content of HTML. Accordingly, whatever is inside the title is the content of the title. Now you will say what is the content of meta? So meta is a self-closing tag. There are two types of tags in HTML, one is the self-closing tag, and one is the pair tag. What happens in the pair tag is that your opening tag is the closing tag. So this is the basic structure of the HTML website. Now here you saw that the background has turned red. Who is the reason for this background red? This is happening because of CSS. If I remove CSS from here, and tell CSS to move away quickly, what will I say to CSS? Move away quickly. And as soon as I tell CSS to move away quickly, it will have to move away from here. I will reload the page. So you can see that it has moved here. Similarly, I can also say to JavaScript, move away quickly. Now see, if I say from here, the alert will also stop. So you see, if I reload now, the alert will also stop. So the CSS and JavaScript I added to this HTML content, this is additionally CSS and JavaScript functionalities to link with this HTML page. Now I have already told you about the title tag. This is used to set the title of the page. Now the only purpose of this is that you see the title here. The search engines that are there, they also use it. That is, the search engines, if you write here, Code with Harry HTML, then the HTML introduction of Code with Harry, HTML working, I have put all these titles on the page. You see here, HTML introduction is the title of the page. So these titles of the page are used by search engines and are parsed. Now see here, if I change the page, then the title of this page is HTML working. Now I will change the page again, you see here the title of this page is HTML installation. So the titles keep changing. Along with that, as I keep changing it, it will keep changing, as you can see. Okay? So the title of HTML pages does not only mean that you see this up here, it is also very useful in SEO. And it tells what is the content inside the page. So it describes the content of the page. Like I am getting to know here what is HTML execution. HTML execution means how HTML is being executed. I am being told about this page. So changing the title of the page is a very good SEO practice. So we will make a website from any framework, we will keep changing the title of the page. Now here in this head section, in the head section, there is metadata of the page. Like the title is done, and which script do you want to link, that is done. Along with that, there are other meta tags about which I will tell you later. Meta tags basically mean that how is the HTML document, it is told about it, keywords are added, description is added. Meta description is a very important keyword for SEO. That is, you can write about what this page is about. If you go to my website, then you will get to see here in view page source that the meta description tag is attached. This is compressed HTML, so don't be confused by this. But here you can see that the meta description tag is attached, which describes this page. If we talk about Google, then Google shows the meta description here. Now I want to show you people that dog type, HTML, what happens inside the head after this, the meta text, title text, script text of the page, there are also link tags. So now the script tag, you can put it just before the body and you can put it above too. And what is the difference in this, we will talk about it in the course ahead. But here you can see that I used the link and added CSS again. Then after this, the body is the main content of the website, which you can see on this page. On this page. So what you will see on this page will be the body. Okay, whatever you put inside the body, you will see it here. And whatever script you put, it will be executed. Now by putting a script here and by putting a script in the head, what will happen, I will tell you in the course ahead. But this is a basic structure of the HTML website. Lang is equal to en is an attribute. It is inside any tag. Lang is equal to en. So Lang is an attribute whose value is en. So these key value pairs are used which tell about this tag. Like in the meta tag, name is equal to description is used. So the name is equal to description is an attribute. And if you hover in VS Code, then it will tell you a lot about it. See, I hovered on the name, it is telling about this attribute that why this attribute is used, how it is used. Now most of the content that is inside the body, mostly the HTML raw, you will copy it. Mostly from websites like Codewithari.com, you will come here and copy the source code. Like if I talk about forms, then you will come to this page of HTML forms and you will copy it from here and start making your form and modify it. So copying and pasting is very important according to me. As a senior developer, you should know where to copy and paste and when to do it. And I am not saying this sarcastically. Okay, I am not saying sarcastically. This thing will always be the same. Now you type it or copy and paste it. Obviously, you will prefer to copy and paste it because this change is not going to happen. The form will remain the same. And if you copy and paste, then your time will be saved. Then innovation, you have to put your mind where the thing cannot be copied and pasted. So you understand it as a sigma rule that you will copy and paste the thing that has to be copied and pasted. And where you have to put your mind, that cannot be copied and pasted. So you will save time and put your mind there. The most important part of being a senior software developer is to where to copy and paste from, which stack overflow question to copy and paste from, and how to paste it from where. Copyright code, whatever it is, you can understand. I have said my copyright statement. But this statement is very strong. Now I will tell you about a technique with which you can develop this website. Whatever we will develop here, you will be able to see it in this mobile. Now listen to the steps carefully. Right click, open terminal. And write ipconfig. If you are in the old version, then you can open command prompt or powershell. As soon as you enter by writing ipconfig, you will see here that you will see ipv4 address. 192.168.1.199 Now the IP address we have got here, I will copy it. So I will copy this ipv4 address. And I will write live preview in my settings. This local IP host address to host your files on, this is written. I will write my IP address instead of this. And after doing this, I will restart my VS code. You have to ensure one more thing. That you go to your Wi-Fi settings. Make your network a private network. It should not be a public network. It should be a private network. Network and internet, Wi-Fi. Whatever Wi-Fi you are connected to, make it a private network. And now you will right click and do show preview. So you see here, you will get to see your IP address. Slash index.html I can also use this on my phone. So I will quickly put this IP address here. So I put 192.168.1.199.5000 You can also put 3000. Whatever your port is, put it. And here you see, my website has been previewed on the mobile. This trick comes in handy when we want to preview on our mobile. Because most of the websites are seen on the phone these days. So we want our phone users, they can enjoy our website well. And we are developing in the computer. So that testing will be done. Now if you have not put your review in the first video, then I will request you to come to the first video and review your course. I told you in the last video, please review it. Put an initial review. How did you feel after seeing so much course? Now write initial review there. As soon as you write the initial review, people will know what is the initial review of this course. You give me 5 stars. Along with that, do access it from the playlist description. Click here and bookmark it. Or if you click on the star, it will be bookmarked. And it will start showing in your bookmarks. I have bookmarked it here. Click here and save it. Very few people have accessed the playlist. So I want everyone to access this playlist. Bookmark and save this playlist. So access the playlist. Like the video. Give your village and uncle's land to me. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. I will see you next time."}
