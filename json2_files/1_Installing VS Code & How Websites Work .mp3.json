    "text": " From today's video, we will start the Sigma Web Development course. Like this video with high energy, because in this video, I am going to make you a profitable web developer from zero. This course will be very modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come, a lot of things have come in JavaScript that make work very easy. A lot of technologies have come that will make your work very easy. This course will be for those people who know nothing. You know zero if this course is for you about web development. We will start from zero, but in the future we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course, I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. The course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you what exactly the course content will be in a while. But you guys have faith that I will make you a full-stack developer. A lot of projects will be done for you in the course. And at the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that your grip on web development can become very strong. According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below, I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites for you so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded the Google Chrome browser here. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work. But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner. What I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And as the videos come, you will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write here. Download VS Code Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system. Then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that VS Code has come here in my Downloads folder. And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here. And here you can see that I can double-click the VS Code setup and install it. So simply install VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game. You can read the agreement here quickly. This license applies to... Damages. And after this, I will accept the agreement. You can also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. I am the fastest reader in the world. Next. It is important to check both icons here. It is very important to check both icons. Check it. If you want a desktop shortcut. That is, if you want to get a shortcut on the desktop. Click on the Create a Desktop icon. And after this, we will do the next. Then we will install. If your PC is fast like me, then it will be this fast. But if your PC is slow, then there is no problem. It will be a little slow to install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because these videos. I want you to follow exactly. As soon as I put the video, you get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely. Ideally, you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Don't be afraid to see this. Beginners, don't be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again. If you already know things. We are taking a beginner-friendly start here. In the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything. In the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. Hi. Okay, I will request you guys. Tell me in the comment section. What is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or an intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section. How much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please, you guys do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner. You don't know what VS Code is. Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you will say. Harry, I can edit code in notepad. So yes, do it in notepad. It will also be done in it. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will be done in it. Let's set it up here. And show what is there in it. Which makes it a little different from notepad. Look here, let's set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. My theme. And I have done all this. Next section. After this, next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again, here are some tips. I am telling you. That's it. Your VS Code is here. It has started. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see. You can make a new file here. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you guys. That you close it. Yes, you guys close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. And we will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand. We will do related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in Windows. So you can see here. That an option called Open with Code is coming. This option called Open with Code. Helps you to open this particular folder in VS Code. You will select it here. Now what will you do here? You will say, Yes, I trust this file. Click on it here. Yes, I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. Means if I click on plus here. To make a new file. Suppose I have written here. Index.html Write it now. Even if you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Hit enter. And after this. What will I do? That I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. Suppose I wrote this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is white in color. This dot means. That you have not saved this file. Please save it. Hit ctrl s and it will be saved. I will recommend you guys. Go to the file. Enable the auto save option here. So as you type it. You will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly. As you type it. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise if you want to save with ctrl s. Then you can disable this option. One more thing I would like to do with you guys. Click on gear here. Then click on settings. And search here. Mouse. Mouse. Mouse. Now see here. Editor. Mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? I will tell you. Check this and close it in settings. Now you don't have to be scared at all. What is VS code? Why is VS code? How is it? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes, but you don't have to see all this. Now you will simply press ctrl. If you scroll like this. So what happens? That your font size. It changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? It is a very simple logic. That here in downloads. What happened in the folder named. Sigma web development course? That this file was made. Index.html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Assume I make a file named this.txt. I write in it. This is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. You can see. So this folder. And this VS code. Both are running in sync. Okay. Now if I open this file from here. From the notepad. And I show you. My file opened in the notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I will not use the notepad. Because there are some things in VS code. Which the notepad does not give me. And I want that I get those features. I don't want to overwhelm you. But I show you. What is there in VS code? Which you do not get in the notepad. If I write here. Assume.html. If I hit enter. Then it automatically. It gave me the opening and closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me a boilerplate template. Of html. If I click on it. Then see the basic code of html. It came here. We will discuss about it later. You don't get overwhelmed by it. But I want to tell you. How it is beneficial in VS code. Why we did not use the notepad. Why we used VS code. And this feel. We are getting a good feel. The developer feel. The hacker feel. That feel is also important. Then you will get confidence. To do coding. Now for Mac and Linux users. I want to comment here. Exactly similar things are going to happen. For you too. I am using windows. Because I have a windows laptop. I can't use three laptops. Linux, Mac and Windows. I can't use all three at once. So for you. Exactly the same things will be there. In fact, I should say. Similar things will be there. Not exactly the same. Very similar things will be there. Okay. So you can follow along. Very easily. So don't worry at all. I will tell you about some extensions. In a while. And you will enjoy. Using those extensions. And you will also say. It's fun. What did you recommend? But I will tell you in a while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you. You will enjoy. Before that. I want to tell you. That here. You will click on the right. Click on the command palette. So here. There are a lot of options for VS Code. You don't need to know all these options. As we move forward in the course. Whatever feature. As it comes into use. I will keep telling you. And you guys use it. But what I will do here now. I will toggle a screencast mode. You don't have to do this. But I will do it. You will know what will happen. I clicked. So you see. I will type anything. If I press caps lock. So here caps lock will be clicked. So you will know. Which button I pressed. Now this thing is for you guys. Not at all relevant. But I just want to tell you. What is the screencast mode? What is the screencast mode? We can change its settings from here. Now here you see. The screencast mode has a vertical offset. What does vertical offset mean? If I make the vertical offset 0. So it came up. If I make the vertical offset 70. So it came down. I will make it 60. I will make it 60. If I give space here. So it came here. If I make it 80. So it came here. That means. From bottom. How much will it look up? So I made it 0. In fact, I made it 1. Now I will type anything here. Suppose I did this. It will show you at the bottom. Which is ideal. So what I will do is. I will close this this.txt file. I will close the settings tab. These are tabs basically. Like tabs in chrome. Your tabs are exactly the same. So I hope you know what it is. What we have written about it. You will forget. I will tell you step by step. What exactly is what? You can also close the welcome page. Of VS Code. By any chance. If you want to zoom in on VS Code. Which I will do. Because I am recording a video. Now add control plus. Add the plus of numpad. Look below. I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in. Because I am recording videos. So ideally I would like. That you can see the screen from a distance. But when I am doing my coding. Then I don't zoom in so much. Because you have to keep this thing in mind. So these are related to VS Code. Now I want to tell you. How do websites work? A website basically. Works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is client. One is server. Who is client? Who is the other? Server. Who is the third? Browser. Who is also called Babu brother. Browser. So browser, client, server. What is this client? What is this server? What is this browser? I am the client. You. All of us. Who use a browser. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am the client. I will say this to the client. When I write codewithharry.com. Suppose I write codewithharry.com. So what do I say? I say. From this browser. Please give me codewithharry.com website. Or if I write here. YouTube.com. I say. Give me youtube.com website. I say. Browser. Give me youtube.com. I want to see YouTube. What does the browser say? Do you want YouTube? Take this. So here. I will enter youtube.com. So from the server. He brought youtube.com. Do you understand? From the server. He brought youtube.com. He showed me this screen by parsing. This work happened so soon. Because my internet.com. Internet speed is very fast. It is so less. People are even faster these days. But still. According to my locality. It is very fast. Okay. So with this fast internet speed. Everything is very fast. Okay. So the client sends a request to the server. Through the browser. Browser is the client. That is, my assistant. Whatever I say from the browser. He will do that. Will help me. From the server. To bring this web page. Who is managing the server? Server is being managed. YouTube. YouTube.com. Server is being managed. And inside that server. Some code is written. Which sends me this kind of code. That is, when I write youtube.com. This code came. Now how to convert this code. This work is of the browser. That is, how do I show. This work is of the browser. So the client says to the browser. Hey kid. Give me youtube.com. Browser says. Kid you want youtube.com. Wait. I will ask for youtube.com. YouTube.com. Then the browser goes to the server. That is, a request is sent to the server. Says to the server. Give me youtube.com. The server will give it here. Or will say no. Or will say error. Or will say that the server has been errored. Did not get. Whatever response will be. Ideally which should be 200. There is a response code. 200. With that response. Which is our browser. It comes back to the client. And shows this kind of page. I hope this is clear to you. Client. Browser. Server. So the client is with the browser. Browser is with the server. Back to the browser. So this is how this thing works. This thing is a little more important. I tell you once again. When you write google.com. Any website google.com. So the client. Says to the browser. Give me google.com. Browser says. Hey teacher. You want google.com. Wait. I will also bring it from the server. So goes to the server. Browser and google.com. Brings. And gives you. You have google.com. Now with google.com. The server is all. Images. All videos. Whatever things are there. It sends everything. Like this icon. It sends everything. The URL of these icons. Is also written in this code. And that too. The work of the browser. To display us properly. So the server. It sends a whole bundle to the browser. Sends this kind of bundle. And by passing this bundle. Showing like this. The work of the browser. Now whatever further interaction. Will do. User. Will do. And the user. Will do. So the user will do the interaction. With this page. Browser. Will give additional request. If I do it rightly. And inspect. And after that. I go to the network. And here I write. Assume. Harry bhai. Okay. Assume I wrote. Harry bhai. So see. So many requests. It sent. For images. And many more. It sent. So as you. Interact. Similarly. More requests. Additionally. Will have to send. To the browser. So in total. You consider it. As a server. And after that. Finally. When the kitchen. Ordered. Back. So what did. This waiter. Which is the work of the browser. That waiter. Saw you. Order again. It may be that. That order. Can't be made in the kitchen. For some reason. It is very rare. That you do something. And you did not get it. But it happens. Sometimes. Similarly. Sometimes it happens here too. That error is seen. 404 error. Or then 500 error. Server. Is not working. Such errors. Whenever. You get to see. Then also. You are told. But ideally. 200. Means. Ok. Response. And you get. Such a web page. So you can. Consider it. Like a restaurant. So whenever you write. Google.com. Slash mail. So if google.com. Slash mail. Available. Then it will show you. And if you write. Code with. Ariya.com. Slash contact. So code with. Ariya.com. Slash contact. If available. Then. The client. Sends a request. The browser. Then sends the server. The server. Then processes the request. After this. The server. Sends the data back to the browser. And whatever data. Browser. Showed the client. Then the client. Did something. The browser. Send the same request to the server. Then the server. Sent something. Whatever data. The server sent. It came back to the client. Through the browser. And so on. So now you will say. All this is fine. But what is this back end? What is the meaning of back end? Back end is. Because you have a blog. There is a lot of data in the blog. So what will you do? Will you store every web page of the blog separately? Or will you generate that content dynamically? You will generate that content dynamically. I take the example of Google. If I search for Harry here. So you can see here. That the header of Google. These are the links. This format does not change at all. If I write here. Suppose. Shubham. Okay. Suppose I wrote Shubham here. So as soon as I write Shubham here. Now see. That when. When. When. When. When. When. When. When. When. When. Now see. When I wrote Harry. It's very similar content. Google is showing me. So what does Google do? The server of Google. Its back end. Back end processes data. Somehow. So that. This kind of HTML. For corresponding query. Sent. That is when I write Shubham. So send this. When I write Harry. So send this. So the process of generating this thing. What system is happening through. The same back end. Now this back end. Can be Django. This back end can be Flask. This back end can be NodeJS. This back end can be. This back end can be. This back end can be. This back end can be. This back end can be. This back end can be. This back end can be. This back end can be. This back end can be. And the database in the back end. That is used. Means the code of the back end. The client does not see. This is the front end code. Which sends the server. And server. How did this code make? We do not know. Because this. The code is running on the server. If you are getting confused. Then don't get confused at all. You will understand all this. We will see the back end. In the future. Now we understand. Front end. How does it work. Now the front end. It is primarily made up of three languages. HTML. Endless. It is primarily made up of three languages. HTML, CSS and JavaScript These are the 3 languages which are needed If you are making a website Every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript If you use only HTML It becomes a basic skeleton of a website After that when you use CSS, you can style it Like this button is like this, it is only because of CSS Along with that, this button is red This button is curvy, it is all because of CSS These edges are all because of CSS CSS is all about styling What color will this button be What will happen by hovering All these things are done through CSS CSS is the beauty of HTML HTML is the existence of any page It is a standard which is agreed upon So that the browser can understand how to parse The job of the browser is to parse the HTML HTML is a skeleton It is a standard Any website in the world will be made in HTML This is a standard So that everyone can make the same type of pages If someone is making a browser, then the same language has to be parsed If you have learned 80% HTML as a beginner Now some things happen directly through HTML If I write a very quick HTML code I am writing HTML code like this I have used the emmet abbreviation You don't have to worry about how I have written this code I will write this is HTML And I can open this HTML file directly And as soon as I open this HTML file You can see it will open like this I can open this directly And it has opened But it is not styled This HTML file is very basic You can run videos directly through HTML I have an HTML file which I will show you I will change this HTML file So that we can show videos There is a video tag in HTML If I put video 1.mp4 You can see that the video has been automatically shown This is the advantage of using VS Code I will reload this I can play this video I have to write controls to play I will refresh this I can play If I put video 2.mp4 I have put video 1 I have two more videos I have some more videos If I put video 2.mp4 You can see video 2 If I put video 3 My third video will play I will reload this And you can see I can play this So this is our third video I have put video 3.mp4 I will close this And we can play video 4 I will close this And we can play video 4 I have a DJ video So you can see Music Music Music You can make such things You don't have to do anything else You can play videos You can do this with html If you want to style this If you want to have a border I have to use CSS CSS adds beauty to any website Then comes JavaScript Which adds interaction For example, when I click on search When I write code with HRE Why did this come Because a request came And for this query Results of autocomplete came So these things are done with JavaScript This is called client-side scripting If we want to do scripting here We can do it with the help of JavaScript This is also called brain I am talking about website Beauty with brain And brain with JavaScript JavaScript helps you make the page dynamic If you want to change the content It's all done with JavaScript Mosquitoes are coming here My racket is working Like the video When I was in college I was told that I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript Learn 100% HTML and 100% CSS But this is wrong Why? HTML is 80% CSS is 40-60% JavaScript is 50-70% You can start web development In this course I will tell you about chat gpt and web development We will talk about it So don't run after perfection Don't think that I will do HTML for 1 year And then CSS for next year And then JavaScript for 3rd year HTML 80% CSS 40-60% And JavaScript 50-70% You can make a good website And as you make website Your experience will teach you more HTML, CSS, JavaScript And you will not even know that you have perfected HTML, CSS, JavaScript While you are making money and working as a professional web developer So you are earning along with learning And with that you are also improving your skills So don't think that I will make a website only when I remember all the HTML tags I will make a website only when I remember all the CSS properties I will make a website only when I remember all the JavaScript I will teach you only that much We are going to learn what matters I don't want you to learn for years So I have designed this course like this And you will learn the rest from practice I will teach you many practices in this course There are a few mosquitoes to learn sigma web development We will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript And I will teach you tricks in this course Which you have not heard anywhere And I have learned different tricks in my career I have learned some amazing tricks in my career And I want you to learn all the tricks If you have any doubt in this course You can use the hashtag doubt And ask your doubt I am going to try to answer all the doubts I will try to answer all the doubts If you have any question You can use the hashtag doubt And don't use the hashtag doubt in the comments You can use the hashtag doubt in the comments So that I can prioritize the reply of the hashtag doubt I will try to answer all the doubts And you will learn everything in this course So like this course If you are laughing, smile on my face So what is react, next.js, angular So all these are the front end frameworks Which help you to use JavaScript HTML, CSS, JavaScript is the basis of the website Which helps you to make the process fast How?
