    "text": " In this video, I will tell you what are ID and Classes? The concept of ID and Classes is one of the most confused concepts. In fact, when I was learning HTML, I was very confused in my early days. ID means Unique Identifier. That is, if you give an ID to an element, you will not give that ID to the other element. But Class means that if you want to give a property to multiple elements, then you will give it multiple classes. For example, you can give a class named Red to a div and a form. Similarly, you can give a class named BGRed to an article tag and a header tag. Do like this video because we will now go to the computer screen and we will see these things very closely. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I am back. And if you have not accessed the Sigma Web Development course, then access the playlist or click on the bookmark or click on save. And the source code is also being uploaded on GitHub. Now I will come here in the folder and quickly make a folder of video number 9. So I will make a folder of video 9 here. I will write here video 9. And after making a folder of video 9, I will right click on shift and open with code. And here you can see that it has opened in BS code. Now I will write index.html here, I will enter with an exclamation mark. And along with that, I will tell you what are ID and classes. You must have an Aadhar card, right? If not, then you must have some ID. Now don't write in the comment that I don't have an ID. Whenever you go somewhere, you have to show your ID in some of the cases to prove your identity. That I am this. Now if you want to understand about ID and classes in HTML, then ID is what your identity is. Okay? What is it? It is your identity. So listen to a story here. Okay? This is John. Okay? And this is Harry. Okay? These two are very good friends. They are very good friends. They just don't share their lunch. And the rest are very good friends. Okay? In the matter of food, he is not one. And he is a friend in all other matters. Okay? And here you can see that this is John and Harry. Both of them have their own Aadhar ID. So this is my Aadhar number. And John's Aadhar number looks something like this. Okay? So this is John's Aadhar number. And this is my Aadhar number. Okay? Our Aadhar numbers can never be the same. Or if you assume that our friend is made. Assume my friend is made. Tanya and John's friend is made. Assume Shruti. Okay? So their Aadhar numbers will also be different. Okay? This is done. And this is Tanya's Aadhar number. Okay? This is Tanya's Aadhar number. Now, this Aadhar number will be different for every person. So John and Harry were friends. John's friend became Shruti. This is Tanya's Aadhar number. None of these four numbers are the same. These four Aadhar numbers. If I told you any of these Aadhar numbers. I said 35, 34, 5. You will understand that we are talking about Harry. And if I said 54, 56, 56, 7. You will understand that we are talking about Shruti. And if I said 34, 56, 85, 68, 63. Then you will understand that we are talking about Tanya. So this Aadhar number uniquely identifies Tanya, Harry, Shruti and John. So what is this? This is their Aadhar number. That is, this is their ID. No one else will get this Aadhar number. Okay? Along with that, suppose John and Harry spent their childhood together. Both of them are big. And they studied in the same class. And the name of that class was Class 10th. Okay? Suppose they are in the 10th class. Okay? Assume it. What is said in assuming? And Shruti is in class 9th. And Tanya is also in class 9th. Okay? So both are in class 9th. Okay? Tanya is also in class 9th. And Shruti is also in class 9th. So what is Shruti's class? It is 9th. Tanya's class can also be 9th. Shruti will not study alone in this class. Or Harry will not study alone in 10th class. There are other children in the class. So the meaning of class is that in one class there is Harry and John. So can a class be multiple of one person? A class can be multiple of one person. Like, suppose Harry is in class 10th. And he goes to a tuition where this class is in 10A. Suppose there are classes in that tuition. So there can be more than one class. One is class 10th. And one is class 10A. And along with that, suppose Harry wears a red t-shirt. So his class is also red. Okay? So the meaning of class is that the class is not being studied. The meaning of class is that he has been classified in this class. Assume it. Now come here. Leave John, Harry, Shruti. Okay? Delete it. I will zoom out and delete it. There is no meaning of this here. Now come to index.html and understand this. Suppose I made a div here. And I gave its class as red. Okay? And I made a span. And I gave its class as red. Okay? The classes I have given, can I give them to different elements or the same class? Yes, I can. But if I want to put an ID in any element. Suppose I put its ID as first div. I can put anything in the ID. So I can't give this ID to any other element. Because this is its Aadhaar card. This element. If there is another div, I can't put it. Then I will have to put something else in the ID. Okay? I put the ID as second div. Okay? And I write second here. And I will write first here. Okay? So this concept of ID and classes. I will tell you personally. I understood it very late. When I was learning WebDeveloper Pant in my early days. No one told me this. That ID uniquely identifies an element. And the class can be put in multiple classes in one element. And one class can be put in multiple elements. Do you understand? Like if I gave it a red class. I can also give it a BG yellow class. Okay? BG yellow. I can give only one class. And if we give a class to a multiple element. Then we put a space. Like if I want multiple classes to be put in this element. Then what will I do? First I will write red here. Then I will put a space and write BG yellow. So in this way I can give multiple classes. To the same element. Can I give multiple ID to the same element? Have you ever heard of someone's two Aadhar cards? Brother, someone made it from here and there. I don't know brother. But there are no Aadhar cards of Adality. Aadhar number is one person's. And Aadhar numbers can't be the same for different people. Okay? One person can't have multiple. Different people can't have the same. But the class. Like if I say which color T-shirt you wear. Or you can wear a red T-shirt. No problem. You will get it if you go on the road. And let's say you like mango. Or like banana. Or like grapes. You will get multiple people. So assume they are in banana class. Or they are in grapes class. Okay? In mango class. So we can classify in one class. And we can give different elements to the same class. So I hope you understood this thing. Now I will write some CSS here. And don't say that you are not reading CSS. And you are writing. What am I writing in CSS now? You guys. Assume that I am writing some alien language. Okay? In style.css. But I am trying to make a point. I will click here. And here the preview of this is looking like this. First and second. I will show you just one thing. I am. There is a class. How do they target in CSS? They do it by dot. Dot red means red class. And hash first div means. Hash means id. Dot means class. Okay? If I say. The first div. Make its background color red. Okay? So by making the background color red of the first div. Its background color will be red. Okay? These are selectors in CSS. And now I don't want to confuse you at all. And I can comment like this in CSS. Okay? But we will read all these things ahead. Now what will I do by dotting red? I will write background color red here. And along with that. What will I do in dot bg yellow? Dot bg yellow will be mine. I have to put a dot. Dot means class. It means class bg yellow. Now I will make the background color yellow. Sorry, I will make it color red. I will not make the background color red. Dot red means its color should be red. See its color has become red. And the background color has become yellow. So this way you can use. IDN classes in CSS. I hope you have understood this. Now one thing to note here. Very important. This is that the IDN classes are. Attributes of the element. This is ID attribute. And this is class attribute. So if I say what are ID classes? Are they elements or not? Attributes of elements are. Now there is another use of ID. I will tell you what is another use of ID. If I take you to Wikipedia. And I write coding. So this page of Wikipedia has come. I will go to some other page. On some big page. So you see that when you go to Wikipedia. On any page. So what can you do? That you can take the link of that particular place. I will show you how this happens. I go to some other page. I scroll down. And here I will inspect. I will see his ID. His ID is this. So I will copy his ID. And if I put here. Hashtag. And this ID. Now if I hit enter. Then he will bring me here. In ICDA 8. So you see if I put it in incognito. He will scroll me. And show that particular ID. You see he will scroll. Instead of showing me this. He showed me by scrolling. Because he wants to bring me to this ID. So ID also works in linking. So ID. Remember this. Very few people will tell you. That you can generate links. If you write ID by hashtag. In front of any link. So when you open that link. He will focus that ID. Like he is giving me in this case. You can see that as soon as I am hitting enter. So maybe I did the wrong ID here. But you got the point. You got the point. Here 29.29. And if I hit enter. So you see I have come down. If I open incognito tab. Or if I reload it. So you see I have come down. If I scroll it up. And after this. If I open new tab. And. If I do this. So you see he is bringing me to the same page by scrolling. On the page where this ID is. So I hope you understood ID and classes. Through this video. ID means like Aadhar card. Class means. That a person's property. Like he likes red. Or in which class he is. One element can be given in multiple classes. One element can be of red color. And its background can be yellow. And the other element. Its color can be red. And its background can be yellow. So red class can also be applied to multiple elements. Red class. So you can apply red class. If you want. On a fake element. And in one element. You can also apply red class. You can also apply yellow class. So I hope you understood. So that's all for this video. Guys. I was reading captions. And I laughed. Reading captions. So I told him. To name the village land. And I laughed. 5-10 times. Very fast. I told him to access. Name your village land. My name. So on this. Access the playlist. Access the github. Like the video. And in the comment section. Write hashtag sigma batch op. Thank you so much guys. For watching. And I will see you. Next time."
